# 👋 Hi there, I'm Kim Huong (Hazel)

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student. To deepen my frontend knowledge, I completed the Frontend Master Course at CFD Circle in 2023.

💻 I'm a Frontend Developer with 1 year of experience working on landing pages, homepages, CMS, and e-commerce websites (since mid-2024).

I have a passion for technology — whether it's easy or hard, I always keep learning and practicing to improve day by day.

I’m currently learning IELTS to improve my English skills and to earn an official certificate.
